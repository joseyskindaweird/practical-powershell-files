# Practical PowerShell Scripts, by Strange

Powershell scripts for automation, first batch of Powershell scripts made by me.

One command is all you need. Open Powershell as administrator and run this:
``````
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strangetheproot/practical-powershell-files/main/scripts/PackageManager.ps1 | iex
``````
