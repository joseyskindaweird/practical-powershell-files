# Practical PowerShell Scripts

## Powershell scripts for automation, first batch of Powershell scripts made by me.
powershell is kinda buttcheeks so i won't work on this all that much

One command is all you need. Open Powershell as administrator and run this:
``````
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joseyskindaweird/practical-powershell-files/main/scripts/PackageManager.ps1 | iex
``````
